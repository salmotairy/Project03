# Final Project (bzCards)

## Preface

Here is a first version from my web application **BzCards.** The app is very simple and easy to use and has only basic features to shows it is feasibility. choose to lunch it due to a deadline set before.However, there will be a new version released soon with add features.

## From Where it came

More than 8 years ago where smart phones applications and social networks start to become part of our lives. I was challenged by few friends to come up with an idea that genuine and unique. I was in Australia and before that I was in USA. The fact that I was impressed by how Australian care for environment far more than even American. The australian advancement in environmental friendly solutions solution are very big.

As a student in WDI with General Assembly in a course sponsored by MISK I was asked to develop an application of my choice at the end of the course. Nothing better from prototyping my idea aiming for fund to make it real ing of working on it but fortunately I developed my skills and reach a good point. However, I find myself lack of time to complete all what I think to do. Thus, due to the deadline I choose to remove a lot of uncompleted features to make the game work with its current features.

## What in this app.

In this application:

- The user can sign up and sign in.
- The user can list links to all users profiles, however what can be seen is only a connect button until it approved then the card will be seen.
- The user can have in its own profile cards and stacks.
- The cards is user personal cards and the stack contains other people cards.

It is not that big application at this moment but it will be in the future. However, please note that this version may have some errors and I appreciate your patient and feedback.
